This document outlines how to configure EAS Build for some common scenarios, such as monorepos and repositories with private dependencies. The examples described here do not provide step-by-step instructions to set up EAS Build from scratch. Instead, they explain the changes from the standard process that are necessary to accommodate the given scenario.

## How to set up EAS Build with a monorepo

- Run all EAS CLI commands from the root of the app directory. For example: if your project exists inside of your git repository at `apps/my-app`, then run `eas build` from there.
- All files related to EAS Build, such as **eas.json** and **credentials.json**, should be in the root of the app directory. If you have multiple apps that use EAS Build in your monorepo, each app directory will have its own copy of these files.
- **If you are building a managed project in a monorepo**, please refer to the ["Working with Monorepos" guide](/guides/monorepos.mdx).
- If your project needs additional setup beyond what is provided, add a `postinstall` step to **package.json** in your project that builds all necessary dependencies in other workspaces. For example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "cd ../.. && yarn build"
  }
}
```

## How to use private package repositories

See [Using private npm packages](/build-reference/private-npm-packages) to learn more.

## Using npm cache with yarn v1

By default the EAS npm cache won't work with yarn v1, because `yarn.lock` files contain URLs to registries for every package and yarn does not provide any way to override it. The issue is fixed in yarn v2, but the yarn team does not plan to backport it to yarn v1. If you want to take advantage of the npm cache, you can use the `eas-build-pre-install` script to override the registry in your `yarn.lock`.

#### Example

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "eas-build-pre-install": "bash -c \"[ ! -z \\\"$EAS_BUILD_NPM_CACHE_URL\\\" ] && sed -i -e \\\"s#https://registry.yarnpkg.com#$EAS_BUILD_NPM_CACHE_URL#g\\\" yarn.lock\" || true"
  }
}
```

## How to use git submodules

If you are using the default VCS workflow, the content of your working directory will be uploaded to EAS Build as it is, including the content of Git submodules. If you are building on CI you will need to initialize them, otherwise, empty directories will be uploaded.

If you have `cli.requireCommit` set to `true` in **eas.json** you will need to initialize your submodules on EAS Build worker.
First, create a [secret](/build-reference/variables/#using-secrets-in-environment-variables) with a base64 encoded private SSH key that has permission to access submodule repositories. Next, add an `eas-build-pre-install` npm hook to check out those submodules, for example:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

mkdir -p ~/.ssh

# Real origin URl is lost during the packaging process, so if your
# submodules are defined using relative urls in .gitmodules then
# you need to restore it with:
#
# git remote set-url origin git@github.com:example/repo.git

# restore private key from env variable and generate public key
echo "$SSH_KEY_BASE64" | base64 -d > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# add your git provider to the list of known hosts
ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

git submodule update --init
```
