<Head title="Introduction to EAS Update" />

**EAS Update** is a hosted service that serves updates for projects using the `expo-updates` library.

EAS Update makes fixing small bugs and pushing quick fixes a snap in between app store submissions. It accomplishes this by allowing an end-user's app to swap out the non-native parts of their app (for example, JS, styling, and image changes) with a new update that contains bug fixes and other updates.

All apps running the `expo-updates` library have the ability to receive updates. To start using EAS Update, continue to the [Getting Started](/eas-update/getting-started.md) guide.

Still using Classic Updates? We moved those docs to [the archive](/archive/classic-updates/introduction).
