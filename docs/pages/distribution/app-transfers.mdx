There are two different representations of your app to consider when handing over ownership to another entity: the app as it exists on Expo Application Services (to create builds with EAS Build, send updates with EAS Update, etc.) and the app records on the Apple App Store/Google Play Store (to distribute the app to end-users). The following guides explain how to handle app transfers in each case.
